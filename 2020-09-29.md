~~Showing up everyday is the work.~~Worked all day to make sure that I finish the task available on chooselife. Complete the [[minshift]] MOOC today. Epic React was launched and I could not afford to purchase it. I hope Kolade can pick up a license we can use together. I am still focused on finishing all the weekly tasks I set up in yesterday's [[2020-09-28]] note.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
