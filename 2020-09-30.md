Today is the last day in september and I am some miles far off reaching my goals for the year but I am gathering consistency.

Some of the things I want to acheive today is to complete the learning how to learn course and watch the Static testing section of the Testing JavaScript, Complete SQL course on youtube, Finish my task for chooselife.
