Today is the last day in september and I am some miles far off reaching my goals for the year but I am gathering consistency.

Some of the things I want to acheive today is to complete the [[mindshift]] course✅ and watch the Static testing section of the Testing JavaScript, Complete SQL course on youtube, Finish my task for chooselife. Read Refactoring UI book ✅ .

Subscribed to seth Godin blog via email to get notified each new day. My Goal is to keep up and stay motivated and consistent. Never to delay any live video session to watch later. If it can be done with 5 minutes then it should be done and not delayed.

I should become more of producer than a consumer. Creating is better than using what was created. List out the ideas running in my head on creating stuffs that other people need.
