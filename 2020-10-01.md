Our nations celebrate her indepedence today. Summing up the last 60 years of her existence has been full of dramas in several shades. I am not optimistic on the case of the country but I believe it possible to see a change before my time passes here. I am playing my role and contributing my quota to make people I pass through good citizens who can have conversations about national issues and ask institutional questions necessary for a forward thing society.

On my life journey I should start writing about the [[review2020]] of this great year. Still on track to close out on all my weekly goals as specified here [[2020-09-28.md]]
