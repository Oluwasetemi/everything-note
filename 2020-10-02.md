Completed the pdf material in the refactoring UI pack. Left with the videos and other consumable materials from the lesson. Its a very good material that has changed the way I see UI conversions.My goal is the import on my UI skills and write more frontend code in the coming days.
Covered some grounds with the Mocking chapter of the Testing JavaScript Course. Finally acquired the [Master Gastsby Course by wes bos](http://mastergatsby.com/). Should watch the download the video and use my whole weekend to finish the course.
Begineers JavaScript is 2 videos lesson left.
I started reading the deloying Nodejs course by Kati Fratz. Kati is a very great tutor I love and his teaching are clear.
Still focused to close out the task as I planned for the week. Tomorrow is my last day. A review of the things I need to close out:
1. Beginners JavaScript
2. Initiate the daily dose of [Pirple Nodejs course](https://www.pirple.com/)
3. Complete my [re-export syntax blogpost](https://www.oluwasetemi.dev/re-export-syntax-is-delicious/)

I remember the cs50 classes I was taking. I should use this weekend to close up on all the classed I have missed.

Plan for the Oct 6th meetup at Eve Porcelo meetup.

Hope I will finish the year married and with a new Job. Writing and reading everyday.
