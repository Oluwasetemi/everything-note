Its almost 13hrs spent today which started with morning exercises and for the first time in a while my podcast is clean and I can now listen to fresh released once and maybe listen to songs while doing my morning jogging routing between 6am and 7am. I need to be time conscious by standing up in time. I have stopped reading bible and praying for a while now and I need to build the habit of committing time to my spiritual growth much more again.
Today is the deadline to update my last blog post about re-export syntax and its deliciousness. I need to initial watching of the pirple nodejs course so I can finish it all up this week. I need to close out on chooselife completely this week.
Daily task range from the new course recently acquired `Master Gastsbyjs`, deploying nodejs. Not sure I will be able to touch the SQL course leftover but will certain give it my best. I saw a job looking for a [Developer Educator](https://www.apollographql.com/careers/job?id=f888ee48-c229-4a7f-927e-bc0ac3a67e99).
