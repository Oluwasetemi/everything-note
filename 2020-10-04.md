Watching the [How to Prepare Your Resume and yourself for Technical Interviews](). Read 2 chapter of Learning GraphQL today. Will resume chapter 4 Designing a schema Tomorrow. One quality thing that draws my attention is the inline and named fragments, Union and Interfaces give us a way to return more than one Object type.
