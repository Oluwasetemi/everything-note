Solving the task in the deploying nodejs apps, did not do so much today. Finished the SQL tutorial and I am very happy. Read the remaining chapter of Learning graphQl and should start chapter 6 tonight. Plans to complete the the book reading tomorrow.

I am way off into the week with any goal and it has made me least productive. First thing tomorrow should be me working on what I plan to achieve this week. Finish up all the Job application I have planned. Finish the Beginner JavaScript video.
