# Question

A FIRST LOOK IN THE MIRROR How the topic(s) is (are) relevant to your life.

How you plan to use the information in your future.

Key Topics from Week 1

Slow learners. By using persistence and flexibility, slow learners, can see
things that geniuses miss. Active learning. Try to actively do whatever you are
trying to learn. Mastery learning. Whether you learn it quickly or slowly, you
can still learn it! The value of your past. Seemingly unconnected knowledge from
your past can bring unexpected assets to your work in the present. Remember—
it's typical to feel incompetent when you first try to change. Focused and
diffuse modes of thinking bring very different insights into your learning.
Match passions with opportunities. It’s important to take a strategic as well as
a passion influenced approach to your learning. Work to broaden, not just
follow, your passions. The role of the environment around you. Who you hang out
with, and the environment you live and work in, can make a difference in your
behavior. Occasional small disruptions, as with the clinking in a coffee shop,
can sometimes enhance bigger picture learning. (Also, complex systems shouldn't
just be memorized!)

## Answers - How the topic(s) is (are) relevant to your life? and How you plan to use the information in your future?

While learning is fast becoming part of my life but the effects of the topics
talked about so far has helped me to become more comfortable with the mindshift
this course offers to create a good career path.

The section on Slow learners helped me to realise that the reasons why I often
like to be more patient and carefully about learning, understanding and
mastering new concept. I realize that when I accept that learning slowly is not
a fault but a way to internalize more and bring out more results from the
concept of what I am learning which helped in learning JavaScript after my
university education after several failed attempts at learning 3 other
programming languages, deciding to go slowly and carefully is the reason I now
have a career in Software Development.

Actively Learning has been my lifestyle for a while now when I focus intensely
on a concept till I can understand and actively bring to use. Learning some
programming concept with the active pattern of learning made me a better
developer and teacher of those concept so that my student or Junior developers
can understand them easily while I introduce them to the concepts.

Mastering learning requires combining all my efforts to be able to bring to use
the concepts that I am actively learning. The teachings from the MOOC will help
me to master any concepts I so need to learn. The value of the past experience
has helped in my current Job and career path, where I have failed at learning 3
programming languages prior to now and have used this failure as Catalyst to
push me to learn and master JavaScript I use for web development. The switching
of context between the focused and diffuse modes of thinking is useful when I'm
trying to learn a new concept by putting intense concentration to distill the
concepts and that ability to switch to the diffuse mode to allow the information
to become internalized. Matching passions with Opportunities is helping me to
not rely on my passions but on the broadening my passions with work on
opportunities that comes and inturn deepening of interests and a wider look on
my passions. I now tune my environment to support the things I am learning -
having desk and a monitor where I build software. Creating my personal offices
in my house will help me to tune my environment to support what I am learning.

Solution:
Looking back at several past weeks and all I have learnt. This course is a total changer and I would like to tell you the 3 concepts that have greatly benefitted my life during the period of taking this course.

Mastering in learning has helped me to become a better software developer who has a career in web development and teaching web development by mastering JavaScript and its usage. It has impacted my life in such a way that I find it interesting to learn new concepts so easily and seamlessly. Looking forward it will help me to build a more robust career just because I can master concept needed as I progress along the leadership ladder of my career and more important as I teach and train new developers in mentorship.

The choice of who I hang out with strongly influences who I am and my choice of friends and coworkers for people who we share similar aspirations that fit in my goals has moved forward  my career because we set goals and motivates each other towards the actualization of our career goals day by day. So Its made me overall happy at the kind of person I am becoming and much more opening me to the possibilities of what I can do with my life. I have got new Jobs based on the network of people I associate with. The saying that `your newtwork is your networth` has had most impact on me. The kind of changes this tunning of my environment will make on my life will be to maximize the 20% of people around me to get the 80% of result to reach my goals (yearly, monthly and weeks).

Develop career resiliency by obtaining a second skill, or developing a broad talent stack of many mediocre skills. As I master building softwares I have gained more proficiency in teaching, sales, pitching ideas and much more speaking to audience either physicially or virtually. It's help me get more opportunities to speak and teach at conferences and meetups. its reinforced a certain behaviour to always look for more skills to learn to complement my life.

The whole process of mindshifting is to ensure I am making quality progress in life and career. An all total round development of my human capacity and potentials.
